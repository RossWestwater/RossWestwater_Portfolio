# Ross Westwater's Portfolio

## Description

This is my Portfolio, created with react and stylized with bootstrap. It showcases some of my works, which I look forward to exercise further skill in developing further. If you have any questions regarding any of the items you see, please don't hesitate to reach out to me! The contact section will send an email directly to me and a copy of my most current resume may be downloaded, if you're in need of a full stack web developer! Looking forward to connecting!
