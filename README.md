# Ross Westwater's Portfolio

## Description

Created for future employment seeking, this portfolio is a showcase of skills. It is an MVP and needs some fine tuning (under construction), but it is a good starting point for showing some javascript and React usage. I look forward to continuing to improve and format this SPA.
